# Preserving Privacy in Markov Decision Process Verification via zk-SNARKs

This repository contains the code and experiments for the paper "Preserving Privacy in Markov Decision Process Verification via zk-SNARKs".

## Requirements

- ZoKrates 0.8.8
- Python 3.11.2
- Bash 5.2.15

## Usage

1. After setting up the environment, run `experiment.sh` to conduct the experiments.
2. The experimental results are divided into multiple parts:
   - The `lists` folder contains the "paths" composed of the results of reinforcement learning agents interacting with the environment in each experiment, as well as the random number sequences generated by the random number seeds corresponding to specific steps.
   - `output_p.csv` contains statistical data for each step of each experiment, including the time required to execute each step and the size of the key files generated.
3. To reproduce the results in the paper, use `fig.ipynb`.

## File Structure

- ZoKrates code is in the `grad` folder.
- Performance experiment results are in the `lists` folder.
